GInitiallyUnowned is derived from GObject. The only difference between the two is that the initial reference of a GInitiallyUnowned is flagged as a ""floating"" reference. This means that it is not specifically claimed to be ""owned"" by any code portion. The main motivation for providing floating references is C convenience. In particular, it allows code to be written as:

	#name : 'GInitiallyUnowned',
	#superclass : 'GObject',

	#tag : 'Base'
}
